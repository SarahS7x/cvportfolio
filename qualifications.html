      <h3>Qualifications</h3>
      <br><br>
      
    <h2>BA (Hons) Media Production Management</h2>
    <h4>DCU, Dublin</h4>
    <h5>September 2017 - May 2018</h5>
    After completing two Higher National Diploma courses, I decided the next big step for me was to get my degree! I did it and got a First Class Honors Bachelor Degree in Media Production Management. 
      This degree was amazing for teaching me how important teamwork is, but how important it is to work and self teach alone and outside of class time. 
      I intensively studied topics like Research Methods, Consumer Behavior, Human Resource Management, Media and Entertainment Law, Project Management, International Media Marketing, Popular Culture Studies and Strategic Media Management. 
      Achieving my degree gave me a massive sense of self and confidence and just urged and pushed me to achieve everything and anything I wanted in life.</h1><br>
    <br>
    <h2>HND Music & Event Management</h2>
    <h4>BCFE, Dublin</h4>
    <h5>September 2015 - May 2017</h5>
    With this course, I acquired knowledge about the music industry and everything involved in it. I learned how to plan a tours/events for bands and artists. The course combined both academic and practical elements.
Some of the modules on the course included: The Music Industry, Marketing and Promotion for Musicians, Professional Development, Music Copyright laws, The Monetisation of Music, Music Publishing, The Live Music Business, Music and Society, Music and Brands, Artist Management, Advanced Music Event Management, A&R and The International Music Market.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>HND Radio Production</h2>
    <h4>BCFE, Dublin</h4>
    <h5>September 2011 - May 2013</h5></div>
    <div id="qualificationspagetext">This two year radio course covered all things radio, from how to hold a microphone, to setting up a radio station. 
    I had the unique opportunity to be involved in the running of the college radio station, which we set up and to apply for a broadcasting license. 
    I gained a solid understanding of music radio programming, presenting, features, news and the making of documentaries.
    The course offered a great opportunity to gain extensive experience in program making. Aside from all the fun stuff, I also studied the legal and business aspects of the radio and media industries intensively. 
    There was a strong emphasis on practical work and team work.<br></div>
