          <br>
          <h2>Spin 1038 - Communicorp, Dublin</h2>
          <h4>Music Programmer/Administrator<br>
              <h5>January 2015 - March 2020</h5>
        
        I was responsible for the music output of the radio station.
          I attended weekly brainstorming sessions, where teamwork was a huge factor. In those meetings, the Programme Director, Music Director 
          and I chose music to put on and the playlist and which music to take off, depending on weekly chart positions.
          I analysed data, reports and monitored competitors and established and maintained contact with relevant shareholders. I was also responsible
          for filing reports and general administrative duties. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>H&M - Dublin</h2>
          <h4>Retail Sales Advisor<br><h5>June 2012 - December 2015</h5>
          <p>I provided excellent customer service in an extremely fast-paced environment.
            Working in retail can be tough at the best of times, but I worked well in teams and actively supported fellow colleagues.
            It was important to minimize stock loss through proactive measures. I also
            showed orientation to detail skills by organising stock on the shop floor and in the stockroom.
