          <h2>Diploma in Ethical Hacking</h2>
          <h4>Alison Courses</h4>
          <p>Aside from being full time on the AWS Cloud Practiioner course, I also completed a Diploma course in Ethical Hacking. 
              Since studying networking and security on the course, it was clear that ethical hacking intrigued me and I wanted to learn more.
              I completed the course by doing extra study in the evening and at the weekends.</p>

          <h2>Python - From Zero to Hero!</h2>
          <h4>Udemy Courses</h4>
          <p>It was important for me to fully understand Python as it is a well used programming language. Studying Python on the 
              AWS course was extremely beneficial, but to gain further knowledge and to get more coding practice, I coded alongside the examples
              in this course.

              <br>
          <h2>Linux for Beginners</h2>
          <h4>Udemy Courses</h4>
          <p>While also learning Linux fundamentals extensively throughout the AWS course, I also studied Linux on the side on
              Udemy. It was important to me to fully understand and reiterate my knowledge further.
