      <h3>My Skills</h3>
      <p>
      I have many skills that I have gained, both from education and throughout my working life. 
      I have worked in retail and also experienced working in a very busy office environment. Within these different roles, I learned many skills such as how to have excellent customer service and
      how to work within in a team, which is very important in any job.
      <br>
      <br>
      As well as hard skills, I have a number of soft skills that I am extremely confident in. 
      I have an extremely strong work ethic, excellent time management and a massive ability to work well under pressure. 
      I am very adaptabile, having come from a media background into the tech and cloud world. I have fantastic decision making and
      negotiation skills. 
      <br>
      <br> 
      Thanks to the fabulous teaching staff of Generation UK & Ireland and Amazon Web Services (AWS), I have added more skills to the list.
      The importance of learning practical career skills such as effective communication, time management, collaboration, interview skills and CV writing techniques, has been a huge 
      learning experience and has bettered me as a person.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have been extremely lucky to take part in the AWS re/Start programme. It is a 12-week skills-based training program that covers fundamental AWS Cloud skills as well as
      intensively programming, networking, security and relational database skills through real-world-scenario-based learning, hands-on labs and coursework. 
      <br>
      I am extremely optimistic for the future!
