      <br><h3>Skills</h3></div>
      <p>
      <div id = "skillsnew5text">I have many skills that I have gained, both from education and throughout my working life. 
      I have worked in retail and also experienced working in a very busy office environment. Within these different roles, I learned many skills such as how to have excellent customer service and
      how to work within in a team, which is very important in any job.
      <br>
      <br>
      As well as hard skills, I have a number of soft skills that I am extremely confident in. 
      I have an extremely strong work ethic, excellent time management and a massive ability to work well under pressure. 
      I am very adaptabile, having come from a media background into the tech and cloud world. I have fantastic decision making and
      negotiation skills. 
      <br>
      <br> 
      Thanks to the fabulous teaching staff of Generation UK & Ireland, I have added more skills to the list. I have learned the importance of knowing practical career skills such as effective communication, time management, collaboration, interview skills and CV writing techniques. 
      It has been a huge learning experience and has bettered me as a person. The course was an intense, tech heavy, full-time AWS Cloud Practitioner training programme. The 12-week course is a skills-based training program that covers fundamental AWS Cloud skills as well as
      programming, networking, security and relational database skills, right through to real-world-scenario-based learning, hands-on labs and coursework. 
      <br>
      <br>I have developed and built core skills that allowed me to work exceptionally well as part of a team, while problem solving technical 
      issues using my own initiative. I have learned how to apply core AWS services in the area of compute, storage and networking, including EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, Cloud Formation, RDS, Route 53 and SQL databases.
      I have built core IT fundamental skills, using Linux OS, writing scripts in Python and Bash, as well as understanding how Python can be used to create scripts for AWS.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am extremely optimistic for the future!
